Any config filename in the gifapi folder(s) is a command.

Included are:

* tenor
* giphy
* gfycat
* gifme


In order to use a specific api, you will need to add to your sopel config a section and apikey:

````
[tenor]
apikey = asdgfsdfgjsdkfhgklsdfgklshdfgjk
````

# Personal configs

It is possible to add configs other than the included. This can be done by adding the section

````
[Sopel-GifSearch]
extra = /path/to/directory
````

# NSFW results

````
[Sopel-GifSearch]
nsfw = True
````
